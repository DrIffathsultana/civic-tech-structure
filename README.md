# Civic Tech Structure

The Civic Tech Structure project seeks to improve existing structures and create new ones that make it easier to share replicable processes and practices so that the civic tech community can iterate on each other’s work, improving outcomes for the whole ecosystem.

This process will be made possible by an intensive UX Research phase with the BOP end users via exploratory, structured interviews.<br><br>Each of the 80+ Code for America Brigades is an experiment which generates valuable learnings and new effective processes and practices.<br><br>[Read about the BOP Extension Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7HmROzkFYVyu7cFkzirwgO-F4i8v6ijQQ4PF44f5bE/edit)  |
